To place a piece on the game board, you must provide the letter corresponding to the piece and the location where you want to place it. For example, the command XF4 will attempt to place piece X at the coordinate (F,4).
Note: A piece is always positioned based on its top-left corner, whether it is solid or empty. 

It is possible to move an already placed piece using a new placement command. 

A piece cannot be placed on an obstacle on the game board or on another already placed piece.

To remove a piece from the game board, simply enter the letter corresponding to that piece.

Leave the game
The command ! allows you to leave the current game.

Loading commands
The command < allows you to load and execute a command file. For example, <commandes1.txt will load the file commandes1.txt. A command file will automatically execute one or more commands.
